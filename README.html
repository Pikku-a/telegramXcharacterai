## Credit

I built this on top of this: https://github.com/devXprite/javascript-chatbot

However, the project has changed a lot and there is not much code left from that.

But some stuff is left. Like the Vercel stuff. For example, there is this button in this readme:

*Click this button to configure your Project and deploy it to Vercel.*
  
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FdevXprite%2Fjavascript-chatbot)

I don't know what it does. I haven't tried clicking on it, my courage was not enough. Legend says that people who have clicked on it have never returned. Did they succeed? Or fail? Or something worse...
